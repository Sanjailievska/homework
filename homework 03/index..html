       <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
       <p>The story begins with Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old boy who lives with his abusive Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and spoiled cousin Dudley. Harry is treated as an outcast and forced to live in a cupboard under the stairs. However, everything changes on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a mysterious letter delivered by a giant named Hagrid. The letter reveals that Harry is not only a wizard but also has a place reserved for him at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is introduced to a world he never knew existed. Hagrid takes him to Diagon Alley, a hidden magical street where witches and wizards purchase their school supplies. There, Harry encounters fascinating things like spell books, cauldrons, and magical creatures. He also learns that his parents were famous wizards who died protecting him from the dark wizard Voldemort. Harry survived Voldemort's attack as a baby, leaving him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar and earning him fame as “The Boy Who Lived.” Harry boards the Hogwarts Express and meets new friends, including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, the new students are sorted into one of the four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor, and they quickly bond as they navigate the challenges of classes, magical creatures, and their professors, such as Professor McGonagall and the enigmatic Potions Master, Severus Snape. Harry soon discovers that Hogwarts is filled with secrets. He and his friends learn about the Sorcerer's Stone, a magical artifact created by the alchemist Nicolas Flamel. The stone has the power to grant immortality and produce limitless wealth. Rumors swirl that someone is trying to steal the stone, and Harry becomes convinced that Professor Snape is the culprit, due to his strange behavior and dislike of Harry. Harry's curiosity leads him and his friends into a series of increasingly dangerous situations. They enter the Forbidden Forest, where Harry witnesses a dark, cloaked figure drinking the blood of a unicorn. He learns that Voldemort is seeking a way to return to full power and believes he may be after the Sorcerer's Stone to restore himself. Realizing that the stone is in danger, Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to stop the thief themselves. They embark on a journey through a series of magical obstacles designed to protect the stone, which include tasks like a giant game of wizard's chess, a deadly logic puzzle, and a dangerous encounter with a troll. Ultimately, Harry faces the final test alone, discovering that it was Professor Quirrell, not Snape, who was working with Voldemort to steal the stone. In a dramatic climax, Harry confronts Quirrell, who reveals that he has been possessed by Voldemort. Voldemort, in his weakened form, has attached himself to Quirrell, using him to gain access to the stone. However, when Quirrell tries to seize Harry, he is burned by the touch, and Voldemort is forced to abandon his plan and flee. Dumbledore later explains that Harry’s mother’s love protected him, creating a powerful charm that Voldemort could not overcome. Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to their regular lives at Hogwarts, where they are celebrated as heroes. Gryffindor wins the House Cup, thanks in part to Harry’s bravery and the friends’ loyalty to each other. As the school year ends, Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, with the knowledge that he has a place in the magical world and that he will continue his journey as a wizard in the coming years.</p>
